Miscellaneous Projects
==============

This is a repository for different projects I am doing, which is either:
- Train on programming with C++
- Smaller projects in other language, prefaced with the language

C++ Projects
-----------------

Most of these projects are based on tasks from the course FYS4150 - Compuational Physics teached at the University of Oslo. Some will eventually be from Topcoder.
